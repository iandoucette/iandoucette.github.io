    <p class="char2">[user2]: And what exactly was all that, Chester?</p>
    <p class="char1">[user1]: Pulled in someone new.</p>
    <p class="char2">[user2]: You can't just load someone in like that. It's traumatic, who knows what was going on when they died.</p>
    <p class="char1">[user1]: Easy for you to say.</p>
    <p class="char1">[user1]: Regardless, if we can't even do that what is the point in keeping this thing around?</p>
    <p class="char2">[user2]: Making sure at least something of the entirety of human history still exists! </p>
    <p class="char1">[user1]: Yeah, it "exists" I guess. Why even keep it around if nobody is going to be able to process it?</p>
    <p class="char2">[user2]: I mean, we do. Don't we?</p>
    <p class="char1">[user1]: Not all of it. None of us are going to go through *all* of this. I'm bored to tears by economics but for some reason we still have every single textbook on the subject produced for as long as we had textbooks.</p>
    <p class="char2">[user2]: We've been over this, no.</p>
    <p class="char2">[user2]: How could we possibly just destroy the life work of... everyone?</p>
