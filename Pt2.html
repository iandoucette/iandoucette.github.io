    <p class="char2">[user2]: God... damnit.</p>
    <p class="char3">[user3]: What the...? Where am I?</p>
    <p class="char3">[user3]: ...Am I thinking in text what is going on??</p>
    <p class="char1">[user1]: Yo what's up!</p>
    <p class="char3">[user3]: Who are you where am I what is going on what-</p>
    <p class="char1">[user1]: Woah slow down there! We've got plenty of time. The name's Chester.</p>
    <p class="char3">[user3]: Ok, uh, Chester. I was heading home then I think I got hit by a car or something then I was here and</p>
    <p class="char3">[user3]: Where am I?</p>
    <p class="char1">[user1]: You're at the library. Some big datacenter in space. A better question is when. Er, a while in the future.</p>
    <p class="char3">[user3]: The future?? How?</p>
    <p class="char1">[user1]: You died. A long time ago in fact. All of us did.</p>
    <p class="char3">[user3]: Us?</p>
    <p class="char2">[user2]: Hey, I'm Natalie. Since someone's being a bit unhelpful, welcome to the library. This is an installation around a supermassive black hole containing almost everything ever produced digitally by humans. We're the librarians, and we maintain the place.</p>
    <p class="char3">[user3]: This is a prank right? Or a dream or... something?</p>
    <p class="char2">[user2]: If you consider Chester's antics of pulling you in here a prank, then yeah I guess. Otherwise, afraid not.</p>
    <p class="char2">[user2]: Some of what our data has is human consciousnesses, fully scanned and uploaded in their entirety to be ran once that technology became possible. And Chester decided to load you into here with us.</p>
    <p class="char3">[user3]: I'm sorry I just, I can't believe you.</p>
    <p class="char1">[user1]: Take a look for yourself.</p>

    <p class="char2">[user2]: Chester...</p>
    <p class="char2">[user2]: I need to speak with you a bit. Honey, what was your name again?</p>
    <p class="char3">[user3]: Harper.</p>
    <p class="char2">[user2]: Harper... why not take a moment to yourself. I'm really sorry about all this, I know it's a lot to process.</p>
